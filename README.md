# ‚ûï‚ûñREI Search Bar Calculations‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

- This mod adds the ability to use the search bar of REI as a calculator, works similarly to the mod NEU (Not Enough Updates) for Forge 1.8.9.

- The mod also adds the command **/calc** that functions the same way but as a command instead.

A simple and fast calculator for everyday use!

## üìñ Dependencies
**Requires [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) to function currently**, I do plan on adding support for this mod to work without REI in the future.

## üìñ Why I made this mod?

This mod was mostly made because of Hypixel Skyblock's recent update which forces players to use 1.21.5 for their newest content island, and a new mod for REI added skyblock items to it, was supposed to be the replacement for NEU for the newer version, however, REI lacks this quality of life feature I personally have been missing and my aim is to reach players like me who have also felt the lack of this feature to be annoying, with that I also encourage anyone using REI to give this mod a chance as it does add some nice utility to it if you are playing on a modpack and don't want to open your calculator app every time you need to calculate something.

### **Hope you enjoy using it!**
